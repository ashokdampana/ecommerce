An eCommerce project is basically an online store where people can explore, choose, and buy products from the comfort of their homes. Instead of visiting a physical shop, customers can browse through different categories, read product details, compare prices, and add items to their cart with just a few clicks.

Behind the scenes, the system manages everything smoothly — from displaying products to processing payments through services like PayPal or Stripe. It also keeps track of orders, updates inventory, and stores customer information securely.

In simple terms, an eCommerce project connects businesses and customers in a fast, convenient, and user-friendly way, making shopping easier and more accessible for everyone.
